# StateTreeAI

An experimental project for exploring Unreal Engine's State Tree system for AI behaviors, quest systems, and advanced gameplay logic.

**Project Status:**
🚧 Learning - In Progress

---

## 📋 Description
StateTreeAI is a learning and research project created to explore and master the State Tree system through practical examples. \
Built in Unreal Engine 5.7 using C++ and Blueprints, the project features a testing environment to experiment with various State Tree implementations for AI, quests, and complex gameplay systems.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Experiment with the State Tree system
- Implement AI behaviors using State Trees
- Create a quest system leveraging State Tree logic
- Test new implementations and code patterns
- Build a collection of working examples for practical use

## 💭 Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A personal learning journey through State Trees
- A reference for implementing State Tree features
- A collection of working examples for future projects
- A resource for others learning State Trees, AI systems and Quest system

### 🎓 Current Phase: Learning
**Focus:** Foundation & Core Concepts 
**Status:** In Progress 🚧

Learning the fundamentals of State Trees through practical implementation:
- Understanding State Tree architecture and evaluation
- Basic AI behavior implementation
- Transition logic and conditions
- State Tree tasks and evaluators
- Integration with existing systems

**Current Approach:** Iterative learning with focus on practical examples

### 📚 Advanced Phase (Planned)
**Focus:** Complex Systems & Production Patterns 
**Status:** Planned 📅

Future development will include:
- Advanced AI behaviors and decision-making
- Complete quest system implementation
- State Tree best practices and optimization
- Scalable architecture patterns
- Performance considerations

### 🎮 Future Integration (Planned)
**Focus:** Full-Scale Implementation 
**Status:** Planned 📅

Integration of State Trees with the Gameplay Ability System from the GasAbilities project:

**Q: What is State Tree? ** \
A: State Tree is Unreal Engine's system for creating modular, reusable AI logic and gameplay systems. It's designed to be more efficient and scalable than traditional Behavior Trees.

**Q: Why a separate project from GasAbilities?** \
A: Learning each system in isolation ensures deep understanding and creates focused reference material. Once both systems are mastered, they'll be integrated in a future project.

**Q: What will be implemented in this project?** \
A: The focus is on State Tree applications: AI behaviors, quest systems, and complex gameplay logic. The exact scope will evolve as learning progresses.

**Q: When will this be completed?** \ 
A: This is a learning project without a fixed timeline. Progress depends on understanding and experimentation. Updates will be pushed as concepts are learned and implemented.

**Q: How does this relate to GasAbilities?** \
A: GasAbilities explored the Gameplay Ability System. This project explores State Trees. A future project will combine both systems in a complete game implementation.
